Garden Trails expands Minecraftâ€™s natural world with a variety of new plants and decorative options. From boxwood and camellia to rice and mulberry, each species comes with its wild variant, naturally spawning across different biomes. Players can also enjoy potted versions of their favorite plants, bringing even more flexibility and style to landscaping and interior decoration.

Beyond flora, the mod introduces new fauna with the Silk Moth, a unique entity that brings silk production into the game. Combined with blocks like the drying tray and stick bundle, players gain access to an entirely new resource path centered around natural materials. The goal of Garden Trails is to enrich exploration and creativity by blending plants and wildlife seamlessly into the Minecraft experience.
